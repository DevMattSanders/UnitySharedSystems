This is a collection of systems that I use across various projects.

--- The following external assets are required for these systems to work! ---

-Odin Inspector (Paid)
-DoTween (Pro version not required)
-Easy Save 3 (Paid)

-Remote Config (Unity package)

The '_Dependent Systems' folder is used for systems that any other systems in this package may reference.
This includes general script extensions, the global scriptable system and others which provide a foundation.
